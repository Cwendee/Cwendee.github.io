      Terraform AWS ECS Fargate Infrastructure
    </h1>

    <p class="text-gray-300 max-w-2xl mb-4">
  Designed and provisioned a production-style container infrastructure on AWS
  using Terraform, ECS Fargate, and an Application Load Balancer, following
  real-world DevOps and cloud architecture best practices.
</p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🎯 Problem & Objective</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
  The challenge was to deploy a containerized application that balances security,
  simplicity, and scalability while remaining fully reproducible using
  Infrastructure as Code. The objective was to expose the application securely
  through a load balancer, keep compute resources private, reduce operational
  overhead, and ensure the infrastructure could be reliably created, modified,
  and destroyed.
</p>

  </section>

  <section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🏗️ High-Level Architecture</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    The architecture follows a layered and modular approach that separates
    networking, load balancing, and compute responsibilities. A VPC provides
    clearly defined public and private subnets, with the Application Load
    Balancer acting as the sole public entry point. ECS Fargate tasks run
    privately within the VPC, ensuring controlled traffic flow and reduced
    attack surface.
  </p>
</section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🧠 Key Design Decisions</h2>

  <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

    <p>
      The following design decisions were made to align the infrastructure with
      modern, production-style cloud and DevOps best practices.
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <strong>ECS Fargate:</strong> Selected to remove the need for EC2 instance
        and host management, allowing focus on infrastructure design and
        container orchestration rather than server maintenance.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Private Subnets for ECS Tasks:</strong> Containers are deployed in
        private subnets to reduce the attack surface. All inbound traffic is
        routed through the Application Load Balancer, enforcing a clear network
        boundary.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Terraform Modules:</strong> Infrastructure components such as VPC,
        ALB, and ECS were isolated into modules to improve reusability, simplify
        debugging, and maintain separation of concerns.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Remote State Management:</strong> Terraform remote state was
        configured to ensure state persistence, prevent drift, and support safe
        iteration and collaboration.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">✅ Execution & Verification</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    The infrastructure was built incrementally, starting with the networking
    layer, followed by the Application Load Balancer, and finally the ECS
    Fargate resources. Each layer was validated independently before proceeding,
    reducing risk and avoiding large, error-prone deployments.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🚧 Challenges Faced</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    Challenges included understanding Terraform module boundaries versus
    environment execution, early misconfiguration of remote state, IAM profile
    confusion across sessions, and file path issues when structuring modules.
    These issues reinforced the importance of execution context and structure
    in Infrastructure as Code.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">💡 Key Learnings</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

    <p>
      This project reinforced several core DevOps and cloud engineering principles
      that closely mirror real production experiences.
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        Clear Terraform module boundaries significantly improve infrastructure
        scalability, readability, and long-term maintainability.
      </li>

      <li>
        Terraform execution context is just as important as the code itself.
        Running commands from the correct directory and environment prevents
        unexpected behavior and configuration issues.
      </li>

      <li>
        Incremental validation during infrastructure builds saves time and
        reduces cognitive load compared to large, single-step deployments.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cost awareness should influence architectural decisions early, especially
        when designing networking and managed service components.
      </li>

      <li>
        Small configuration details such as file paths, remote state handling,
        and AWS profiles can have a large operational impact if misconfigured.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  </section>

  <section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">✅ Outcome and Final Result</h2>

  <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The final result is a fully functional ECS Fargate service running in
      private subnets and receiving traffic exclusively through an Application
      Load Balancer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The infrastructure is modular, reproducible, and safely managed through
      Terraform remote state, allowing it to be created, modified, or destroyed
      with confidence.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🔮 Future Improvements</h2>
  <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>HTTPS termination using ACM</li>
    <li>ECS service autoscaling policies</li>
    <li>CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments</li>
    <li>Blue-green deployment strategies</li>
    <li>Enhanced monitoring and alerting</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">🚫 Git LFS & Terraform Providers</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    GitHub suggested Git Large File Storage due to the size of Terraform provider
    binaries. However, provider binaries should never be versioned. The correct
    practice is to exclude the .terraform directory and allow Terraform to
    download providers dynamically during initialization, keeping repositories
    lightweight and portable.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">✨ Closing Reflection</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    This project strengthened my confidence in designing cloud infrastructure
    using Terraform and reinforced the importance of clarity, structure, and
    incremental delivery. It reflects a growing DevOps mindset focused on
    building systems that are secure, reliable, and maintainable.
