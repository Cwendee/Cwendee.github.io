      Lessons from building a Jenkins and Docker pipeline under real constraints
    </p>
  </header>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      When I set out to build this Jenkins and Docker CI/CD pipeline, I thought the
      value would come from getting it to work. What I didn’t expect was how much
      of the learning would come from the moments where it didn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project quietly reshaped how I think about version control, pipelines,
      networking, and deployment safety. Not in a dramatic way, but in the kind
      of way that sticks.

      📁 Starting Calmly with Version Control
    </h2>

    <p>
      Early on, I had a moment of doubt about the state of my repository. The
      directory structure didn’t look quite right, and it would have been easy
      to assume something had gone wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of guessing, I checked the repository state properly. That small
      moment was a reminder I’ve learned before, but clearly needed again. Git
      does not tell its story through visible folders alone. The real truth lives
      in its metadata.
    </p>

    <p>
      From that point on, I trusted the tools more than my instincts when
      something looked unfamiliar.

      🧩 Being Deliberate with How I Commit
    </h2>

    <p>
      I made a conscious decision to structure the project locally first on my
      Ubuntu machine. The repository started clean. Once the application,
      container setup, and pipeline structure were ready, I committed them
      together as a foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      That first commit wasn’t about speed. It was about intent. From there,
      every change was small and purposeful. Each commit told a clear story.
    </p>

    <p>
      When something broke later, I could trace it back confidently instead of
      digging through noisy history.

      ⚙️ Jenkins Taught Me to Respect Boundaries
    </h2>

    <p>
      Jenkins was where most of the real learning happened. Before touching
      pipeline logic, I learned to always check that the Jenkins service itself
      was healthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      One lesson that really settled in was the difference between internal and
      external access. Jenkins can safely use localhost for things running on the
      same machine. The moment anything external is involved, that assumption
      breaks down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once I started thinking consistently in terms of network boundaries, many
      issues made immediate sense.

      🧪 Why Tests Come Before Containers
    </h2>

    <p>
      I designed the pipeline to run tests before building Docker images. The
      pipeline creates a Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, and
      runs tests before any containerization happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      This keeps feedback fast and failures cheap. There’s no reason to package
      an application that’s already failing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">
      🐳 Deployment on a Shared Machine
    </h2>

    <p>
      Deployment was where the project started to feel real. Port 5000 was
      already in use on the host by another container that had been running for a
      long time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of stopping it, I adjusted the pipeline to expose the new container
      on port 5001. This preserved an existing service and allowed both
      applications to coexist safely.
    </p>

    <p>
      The deployment logic always replaces the running container and validates
      success using an application-level health check.
    </p>

      🚦 When the Pipeline Failed Before It Even Started
    </h2>

    <p>
      One of the most educational moments came when Jenkins refused to load the
      pipeline from source control. The same pipeline worked perfectly when
      pasted directly into Jenkins but failed when configured to load from
      GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
      The inline pipeline worked because Jenkins didn’t need to fetch anything.
      The SCM-based pipeline failed because Jenkins couldn’t locate the
      Jenkinsfile at the configured path.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">
      🌤️ What I’m Taking Forward
    </h2>

    <p>
      By the end of this project, the pipeline only turned green when the
      application was actually reachable and healthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      More importantly, it reinforced principles I’ll carry forward. Fail early.
      Validate assumptions. Respect network boundaries. Make deployments safe to
      repeat.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project wasn’t just about Jenkins or Docker. It was about learning to
      build systems that behave predictably under real-world constraints.
