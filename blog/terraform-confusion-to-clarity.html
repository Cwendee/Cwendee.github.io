      What Building a Real ECS Fargate Project Taught Me
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1️⃣ The Confusion That Started It All</h2>
    <p>At the beginning, Terraform felt familiar.</p>
    <p>
      I had already used Terraform to create a VPC, EC2 instances, ECS resources,
      and everything worked. During one class, the tutor said the next step would
      be creating Terraform modules.
    </p>
    <p>That confused me.</p>
    <p>I had multiple <code>.tf</code> files. Terraform was working.</p>
    <p><em>So I thought, are these not already modules?</em></p>
    <p>
      That question stayed with me until I tried to build a real project on my own.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2️⃣ What I Was Actually Doing</h2>
    <p>
      What I later understood is that I was working inside a single root module.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Multiple <code>.tf</code> files</li>
      <li>Resources grouped by purpose</li>
      <li>A setup that worked for learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Terraform treats all <code>.tf</code> files in the same folder as one unit.
      That is why everything worked.
    </p>

    <p>But this approach does not scale well.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>There was no clean separation</li>
      <li>Everything depended on everything</li>
      <li>Reusing parts was difficult</li>
      <li>Managing environments would have been risky</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It worked, but it was fragile.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3️⃣ The Aha Moment 💡</h2>
    <p>
      The big realization came when I understood the difference between a root
      module and child modules.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>The root module is where Terraform runs</li>
      <li>Child modules are reusable building blocks</li>
      <li>Modules accept inputs</li>
      <li>Modules expose outputs</li>
      <li>Modules define responsibility boundaries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once I separated networking, load balancing, and compute into modules,
      things started to click.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understood why environment separation matters. Development and
      production should not share the same execution context or state.
    </p>

    <p>This was no longer about syntax. It was about design.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4️⃣ Why This Matters in Real Projects</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Multiple people work on the same code</li>
      <li>CI pipelines run Terraform automatically</li>
      <li>Multiple environments exist at the same time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without modules and clear boundaries, things break quietly and expensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recruiters are not only looking for tools. They are looking for structure
      and thinking.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 5 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5️⃣ What I Changed in My Project</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Clear Terraform modules</li>
      <li>A dedicated environment folder</li>
      <li>Clean inputs and outputs</li>
      <li>A predictable execution flow</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The code became easier to understand. Scaling became realistic. The story
      behind the project became stronger.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FINAL REFLECTION -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">🎯 Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project taught me that DevOps is not about perfection. It is about
      clarity, safety, and intentional decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding why things break is more valuable than things simply working.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, I finally understand what Terraform modules are really for.
