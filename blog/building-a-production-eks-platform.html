  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">1️⃣ The Fear I Didn’t Want to Admit</h2>
    <p>
      Kubernetes is one of those technologies that carries a reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powerful. Flexible. Industry-standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And honestly? Intimidating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had worked with Docker, Terraform, ECS, and CI/CD pipelines before. Those felt
      structured. Predictable. Kubernetes felt… vast.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were too many moving parts. Too many YAML files. Too many concepts that
      seemed simple on paper but overwhelming in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while, I stayed on the edges — learning just enough to understand what
      others were doing.
    </p>
    <p><em>But I knew avoiding it wasn’t helping me grow.</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">2️⃣ Choosing Discomfort on Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of starting with toy examples, I made a deliberate decision:
    </p>
    <p><strong>If I was going to learn Kubernetes, I would do it the hard way.</strong></p>
    <p>
      I chose to build a production-style platform on Amazon EKS — not because it was
      easy, but because it would force me to understand how things actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meant dealing with:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform</li>
      <li>IAM roles and permissions that actually matter</li>
      <li>Ingress, load balancing, and real networking</li>
      <li>HTTPS, certificates, and DNS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No shortcuts. No magic abstractions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">3️⃣ When Things Started Breaking 🧩</h2>
    <p>
      And break they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, the cluster existed — but nothing worked the way I expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application Load Balancer refused to provision. Ingress resources sat there
      silently. Health checks failed. HTTPS didn’t come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most frustrating part was that Kubernetes rarely screams at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It quietly waits while you figure out what you misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That forced me to slow down and truly understand:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>How IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) actually work</li>
      <li>Why least-privilege policies are easy to get wrong</li>
      <li>How ALB health checks interact with container ports</li>
      <li>Why “it deployed” doesn’t mean “it’s production-ready”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">4️⃣ The Moment It Clicked 💡</h2>
    <p>
      The breakthrough didn’t come from adding more configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came from understanding responsibility boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terraform wasn’t just creating resources — it was defining ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kubernetes wasn’t just running containers — it was enforcing contracts between
      networking, security, and applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once those boundaries became clear, debugging became logical instead of emotional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform stabilized. HTTPS worked. Traffic flowed. Health checks passed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The system finally behaved like a system.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 5 -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">5️⃣ Why I’m Glad I Didn’t Avoid Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>
      Kubernetes is broad. It’s complex. And yes — it can be scary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that complexity exists because it solves real problems at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project taught me that confidence doesn’t come from knowing everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It comes from knowing how to approach unfamiliar systems methodically and safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m still learning Kubernetes. But now I’m learning from experience, not fear.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FINAL REFLECTION -->
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white tracking-tight">🎯 Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project wasn’t about mastering Kubernetes overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about proving to myself that I could step into uncomfortable territory,
      build something real, break it, fix it, and understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that mindset — more than any tool — is what I want my portfolio to reflect.
