  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Evolution: Resilience in Motion</h2>
  <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-10">
    I didn’t begin my career with code; I began with people. As a Customer Service professional across health, e-commerce,
    and transportation & logistics, I have engaged customers in person, over the phone, and via email. These experiences
    sharpened my ability to think on my feet, solve problems in real time, and perform under pressure. The curiosity and
    drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I support operational excellence and
    reliable service delivery.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity</h2>
  <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-12">
    Curiosity has always shaped how I work. Beyond following workflows, I focus on understanding systems and how they can
    be optimized. This drive to explore the how and why led me into DevOps. As I transition into tech, I bring with me
    years of resilience, operational thinking, and a solution-first mindset applied to cloud environments.
