  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">The Evolution: Resilience in Motion</h2>
  <p class="mb-10 leading-relaxed text-slate-400">
    I didn’t begin my career with code; I began with people. As a Customer Service professional across health,
    e-commerce, and transportation & logistics, I engaged customers in person, over the phone, and via email.
    These experiences sharpened my ability to think on my feet, solve problems in real time, and perform under pressure.
    Curiosity and a drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx),
    where I support operational excellence and reliable service delivery.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity</h2>
  <p class="mb-14 leading-relaxed text-slate-400">
    Beyond following workflows, I focus on understanding systems and how they can be optimized.
    This mindset led me into DevOps, where I apply resilience, operational thinking,
    and a solution-first approach to cloud environments.
